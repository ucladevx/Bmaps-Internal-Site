# react-boilerplate
A react boilerplate with webpack 4

Simple react.js boilerplate with custom weback.config file.

Contains redux, css and sass loaders, as well as standard practices for modularizing react code.


# Getting started
### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/howardwang15/react-boilerplate.git
cd react-boilerplate
npm install
npm start
```
By default, the application will be running at http://localhost:8000

### Changing Port
To change the port the application will run on, go into the webpack.config.js file and locate the line (in the devServer object)
```
port: 8000
```
Change that number to another port

### Removing .gitkeep files
Remove the .gitkeep files inside the actions, components, constants, and containers directories. The .gitkeep files were there to allow git to track those folders 

### Generating static files for production
By default, the boilerplate uses webpack to generate static files
```
npm run build
```
The static files will be stored in the /dist directory
